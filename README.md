EPICS Device and Driver Support for Yokogawa's F3RP71 and F3RP61
================================================================

This device and driver support covers both F3RP71 (or e-RT3 Plus) and
F3RP61 (or e-RT3 2.0). They provide an ideal platform of the
combination of realtime Linux, digital/analog I/O and embedded
EPICS. Vendor-supported Linux with PREEMPT_RT ensures the latency less
than 100 microseconds. FAM3 I/O bus access enables the integration of
various FAM3 I/O modules. Embedded EPICS greatly reduces the system
development efforts with standard EPICS facilities without the need
for asynchronous driver. Furthermore, the system can accommodate a
conventional ladder CPU.

Even customized modules can be fabricated for our specific needs under
the support called I/O-Open.

Yokogawa succeeded to develop such an ideal controller based on the
request from KEK control groups in 2008. Since then, many controllers
in EPICS system were implemented.
